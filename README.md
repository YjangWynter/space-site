# Space site! Turning technical documents into a human-centered UI.
## Purpose
This is a project I made within a couple days to A.) Finish an assignment for my DIG3134 class and B.) show off a concept to the folks at FSI.

I used this document I received in my interview as my task to present a webpage format that would simplify the information from the research abstract report into a a interface with a focus on minimalism, an approach I tried to emulate from sites like Medium.com & Smashing Maganize.

The PHP form is simply meet an requirement from my class, but also to make it work as a contact form from a prospective user
